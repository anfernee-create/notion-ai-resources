## Customization Guide {#customization}

### Using Variables in Templates

Variables use the format `{{variable_name}}` and are replaced with actual data:
- {{date}} → Current date
- {{recipient_name}} → Recipient's full name
- {{sender_name}} → Sender's full name
- {{custom_field}} → Custom fields from Notion

### Best Practices

1. **Subject Lines**
   - Keep under 50 characters when possible
   - Include relevant keywords
   - Add urgency indicators when appropriate (⏰, 🚀, etc.)

2. **Email Body**
   - Use clear hierarchy with headers
   - Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
   - Include clear call-to-action buttons
   - Provide unsubscribe option

3. **Formatting**
   - Use emojis sparingly for visual breaks
   - Bold important dates/numbers
   - Use bullet points for lists
   - Include adequate white space

4. **Tone & Voice**
   - Match your brand personality
   - Be professional but approachable
   - Use active voice
   - Avoid jargon when possible

### Integrating with Notion & Zapier

1. Store template text in Notion database
2. Use Zapier to pull template + variables
3. Use formatter to replace variables
4. Send email via Zapier or email service
5. Log sent emails back to Notion

### A/B Testing

Track which templates perform best:
- Create variations with different subject lines
- Monitor open rates and click-through rates
- Log performance metrics in Notion
- Continuously optimize based on data

### Compliance Considerations

- Include unsubscribe link in all marketing emails
- Follow CAN-SPAM regulations
- Get consent before sending
- Honor opt-out requests immediately
- Test for spam triggers

## Template Library Database Structure

Recommended Notion database fields:
- Template Name (text)
- Category (select: Professional, Marketing, Notification, etc.)
- Subject Line (text)
- Body Content (rich text)
- Variables Used (multi-select)
- Last Updated (date)
- Performance Metrics (number)
- Usage Count (number)
- Active (checkbox)

## Conclusion

These templates provide a starting point for your email automation workflows. Customize them to match your brand voice and business needs, test for effectiveness, and continuously refine based on performance data.
