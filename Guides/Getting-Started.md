## Understanding the Basics

### Pages: Your Building Blocks

Everything in Notion is a page. Pages can contain:
- Text and formatting
- Images, files, and media
- Other pages (sub-pages)
- Databases
- Embeds from other tools

### Blocks: The Foundation

Everything you add to a page is a "block":
- **Text blocks**: Paragraphs, headings, lists
- **Media blocks**: Images, videos, files
- **Database blocks**: Tables, boards, calendars
- **Embed blocks**: Google Docs, Figma, Miro, etc.

**Quick tip**: Type `/` to see all available block types!

### Key Commands to Know

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/` | Open block menu |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + N` | Create new page |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + P` | Quick search |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + /` | Toggle dark mode |
| `[[` | Link to another page |
| `@` | Mention page, person, or date |
| `::` | Add emoji |

### Databases: Your Superpower

Databases are where Notion really shines. Think of them as smart spreadsheets with superpowers:

**Six Database Views:**
1. **Table**: Traditional spreadsheet view
2. **Board**: Kanban-style cards
3. **List**: Simple list with preview
4. **Calendar**: Scheduled items by date
5. **Gallery**: Visual cards with images
6. **Timeline**: Gantt-style timeline
