# AI Meeting Notes

## Overview

Notion's AI Meeting Notes feature automatically captures, organizes, and summarizes meeting discussions. This powerful tool transforms raw meeting audio or transcripts into actionable, well-organized documentation that your team can reference and act upon.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Transcription
The AI engine transcribes meeting audio in real-time or from uploaded files, converting spoken words into searchable text documents. It accurately captures all speakers and their contributions.

### 2. Intelligent Summarization
After transcription, AI automatically generates concise summaries highlighting:
- Key discussion points
- Decisions made
- Action items with owners
- Important deadlines
- Follow-up tasks

### 3. Action Item Extraction
Automatically identifies and extracts:
- Tasks assigned to team members
- Deadlines and priorities
- Dependencies between actions
- Related discussions and context

### 4. Speaker Identification
The AI recognizes and labels different speakers, making it easy to:
- Understand who said what
- Follow individual contributions
- Attribute decisions and commitments
- Track participation levels

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Team Meeting
Convert a 60-minute team standup into:
- 2-3 minute summary
