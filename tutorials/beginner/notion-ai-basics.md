## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Prompts

❌ **Vague**: "Write something"

✅ **With context**: "Summarize this meeting transcript, focusing on action items and decisions"

### 3. Iterate and Refine

- Review AI output carefully
- Make manual edits as needed
- Request revisions with specific feedback
- Use AI as a starting point, not final product

### 5. Combine AI with Manual Editing

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Accepting Everything Blindly
