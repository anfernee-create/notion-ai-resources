## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Provide context**: Include your goals, constraints, and current situation
2. **Be specific**: Instead of "organize tasks," specify criteria for organization
3. **Include examples**: Show the type of tasks or format you're working with
4. **Set parameters**: Specify number of items, time frames, priority levels
5. **Ask for reasoning**: Request explanations for AI's suggestions
6. **Iterate**: Start with output, then ask AI to refine based on feedback

## Using These Prompts

### Basic Usage
1. Copy the prompt template
2. Replace placeholders with your actual data
3. Add any specific constraints or preferences
4. Review AI output critically
5. Adjust and iterate as needed

### Advanced Usage
1. Chain prompts together (output of one becomes input of next)
2. Combine multiple prompts for complex analysis
3. Save customized versions for recurring needs
4. Build on AI suggestions with your domain knowledge

### Best Practices
- Always verify AI suggestions against your priorities
- Use AI for first draft, refine with your judgment
- Update prompts based on what works
- Don't blindly accept all suggestions
- AI helps analyze, you make final decisions
