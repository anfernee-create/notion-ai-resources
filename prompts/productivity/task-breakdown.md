# Task Breakdown Prompts

## Overview

These AI prompts help you break down complex projects, goals, and deliverables into manageable, actionable tasks. Use them to move from high-level plans to detailed execution steps, ensuring nothing is overlooked and work is properly organized.

## Work Breakdown Structure

### Hierarchical Breakdown

**Prompt**: "Break down [PROJECT/GOAL] into a hierarchical work breakdown structure:

Create a WBS with major phases, deliverables, tasks, and subtasks. For each element provide description, estimated effort, dependencies, owner, and success criteria."

### Feature Breakdown

**Prompt**: "Break down this feature into implementable user stories with acceptance criteria, story points, dependencies, and priority levels."

## Task Creation

### Comprehensive Task List

**Prompt**: "Create a comprehensive task list for [OBJECTIVE] including preparation, execution, review, and finalization tasks. Each task should have action verb, specific outcome, estimated time, prerequisites, and definition of done."

### Granular Breakdown

**Prompt**: "Take this high-level task and break it into subtasks that can be completed in 1-4 hours, have clear start/end points, and unambiguous completion criteria."

## Task Organization

### Priority Matrix

**Prompt**: "Organize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important, Important/Not Urgent, Urgent/Not Important, Neither). Provide recommended actions and time allocation for each quadrant."

### Batching & Sequencing

**Prompt**: "Organize tasks for optimal batching by type, energy level, and sequential dependencies. Create time blocks with buffer periods."

## Estimation & Sizing

### Time Estimation

**Prompt**: "Estimate time for tasks using three-point estimation (Best/Most Likely/Worst case). Provide confidence levels and risk factors."

### Story Pointing

**Prompt**: "Assign story points using Fibonacci sequence based on complexity, uncertainty, and effort. Provide reasoning and comparison to reference stories."

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Mapping

**Prompt**: "Map task dependencies identifying finish-to-start, start-to-start, and other relationships. Highlight critical path, bottlenecks, and tasks that can start immediately."

### Parallel Execution

**Prompt**: "Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel across multiple team members. Create parallel tracks with sync points and optimized timeline."

## Task Refinement

### SMART Conversion

**Prompt**: "Convert vague tasks into SMART tasks (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) with clear action verbs and success criteria."

### Task Clarification

**Prompt**: "Clarify ambiguous tasks by defining what, why, who, when, where, how, and definition of done. Identify missing information to gather."

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, go detailed** - Break down progressively
2. **Use action verbs** - Tasks should be doable
3. **Make tasks atomic** - Each task = one outcome
4. **Right-size tasks** - Not too big, not too small (2-8 hours ideal)
5. **Include review tasks** - Quality checks matter
6. **Account for unknowns** - Add discovery tasks
7. **Consider dependencies** - Sequence matters
8. **Estimate realistically** - Add buffer time
9. **Assign owners** - Every task needs an owner
10. **Define completion** - Know when it's done

## Task Sizing Guidelines

**Too Large (Break Down):**
- Takes more than 2 days
- Multiple people needed
- Vague success criteria

**Too Small (Combine):**
- Takes less than 30 minutes
- Not worth tracking separately

**Just Right:**
- 2-8 hours of focused work
- Clear start and end
- Single owner
- Unambiguous completion
